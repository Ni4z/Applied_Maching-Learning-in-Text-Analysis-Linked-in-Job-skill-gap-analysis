# Applied_Maching-Learning-in-Text-Analysis-Linked-in-Job-skill-gap-analysis
## Project Description
This Project investigates the qualification gap between university courses and the job market, specifically in data science. LinkedIn job postings and course descriptions from the University of Paderborn are analyzed. Using natural language processing, hard and soft skills are extracted and compared. A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates a machine learning-supported method for analyzing this qualification gap. A transformer-based model was developed, which can automatically extract hard and soft skills from unstructured text with an F1-score of 0.6602.
